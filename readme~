prerequisite
0. the code is tested under ubuntu14.04
1. Caffe and matcaffe should be compiled at external/caffe folder.
2. the pretrained Caffenet should be downloaded and placed at models/VisualNet_10fold.
3. the TUM material surface dataset (i.e. the "Accel/" folder and "Image_Database/" folder in  file "LMT_TextureDB_1.2.zip") should be unpacked at dataset/TUM.

Usage:
run startup.m to set path enveriment.
run caching_haptic.m and caching_image.m to prepare data

run HapticNet_2wide_train_10fold.m to train HapticNet
run VisualNet_train_10fold.m to train VisualNet
run FusionNet_train_10fold.m to train FusionNet-FC2
run FusionNet_69dim_train_10fold to train FusionNet-FC3

run Compare_TCNN_10fold.m to train VisualNet-TCNN
run FusionNet_TCNN_train_10fold.m to train FusionNet-FC2-TCNN
run FusionNet_TCNN_train_69_10fold.m to train FusionNet-FC3-TCNN

notice all the training is performed with ten-fold cross validation, so they might be extremely slow.
